Totem of undying, but with potions.

## How do i get the totems?
That's very simple! Just combine a normal totem of undying with a potion.

## I messed up the crafting, can i undo it?
Yes, just combine the totem you crafted with a glass bottle.

## On what versions can i use this mod?
1.19 and 1.19.2 were tested and it works on both, you should be safe using it on 1.19.1.
